Add code to announce the winner.
We&#39;ll make two methods in the Hippodrome class:
public Horse getWinner() and public void printWinner()

The getWinner method must return the horse that has run the farthest.
The printWinner method displays the winner&#39;s name as follows:
The winner is &lt;name&gt;!
Example:
The winner is Lucky!


Требования:
1.	A getWinner method with no parameters must be created in the Hippodrome class.
2.	A printWinner method with no parameters must be created in the Hippodrome class.
3.	The getWinner method must return the horse that has run the farthest.
4.	The printWinner method should display the winner&#39;s name on the screen in the format specified in the task conditions.


Hippodrome (part 15)


Time to enjoy our creation.
A new snapshot of the racetrack is displayed every half second.
Use the mouse to decrease the size of the console so that only one &quot;snapshot&quot; is visible at a time and remains in the same place.
Then you can watch the race live and even commentate:
- They&#39;re off!
- Homer suddenly flies past Lucky.
- Slevin rushes forward.
- Lucky takes the lead!
- 10 bucks on Slevin.
- Looks like Lucky has thrown off his jockey and is cooling off.
- Homer bursts head.
- An entirely unexpected win for Homer! What a trick!



Hippodrome (part 15)


Now we&#39;ll return to the Horse class&#39;s print method.
Because we&#39;re working with the console, then all the racing horses will look something like this:
........Slevin
....Lucky
..........Homer

In other words, the print method should display a string consisting of dots and the horse&#39;s name.
The number of dots is equal to distance, rounded down to an integer.



Hippodrome (part 15)


There&#39;s just a little left to do: finish writing the Horse class.
The move method is called each time a horse takes a step.
When the move method is called on a horse, the horse must run a certain distance.
The distance depends on the horse&#39;s speed. In its simplest form, this method would look something like this:
distance += speed;

But to make it more interesting, let&#39;s make the speed change a little bit all the time.
To achieve this, multiply the speed by a random number.
A random number can be obtained using the Math.random() method.



Hippodrome (part 15)


We&#39;re almost done with the Hippodrome class.
Add a call to run() at the end of the main method.

Hint:
The run() method is not static, so you can only call it on an object.
But where do you get the object?

Hint 2:
game.run();



Hippodrome (part 15)


We still need to write the Hippodrome class&#39;s print method.
Everything is simple here, too: In a loop, we call the print method on each horse.
Oh, and display 10 empty lines after the loop (using System.out.println()) to make it more beautiful.
