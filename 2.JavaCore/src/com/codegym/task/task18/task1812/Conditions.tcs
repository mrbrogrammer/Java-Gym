Using the wrapper (decorator) design pattern, extend the functionality of AmigoOutputStream.
In the QuestionFileOutputStream class, the following functionality should be implemented for the close() method:
1. Display &quot;Do you really want to close the stream? Y/N&quot;.
2. Read a line.
3. If the read line is &quot;Y&quot;, then close the stream.
4. If the read line is not &quot;Y&quot;, then don&#39;t close the stream.


Требования:
1.	Don&#39;t change AmigoOutputStream.
2.	The QuestionFileOutputStream class must implement the AmigoOutputStream interface.
3.	The QuestionFileOutputStream class must initialize the AmigoOutputStream field in the constructor.
4.	All of QuestionFileOutputStream&#39;s methods must be delegated to the AmigoOutputStream object.
5.	The close() method should ask the user, &quot;Do you really want to close the stream? Y/N&quot;.
6.	The close() method should close the stream only if it reads the answer &quot;Y&quot; from the console.
